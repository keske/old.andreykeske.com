      <h1>Mac OS UI Games</h1>

      <p>
        Two rather simple games, but based on the Mac OS X Interface. This approach shows how the things you are used to, obtain new meaning. My games is continuation of finding the way of interaction between the OS and the user on levels that are slightly noticeable at first sight.
      </p>
  
      <h1>Slot Machines</h1>

      <p>
        3 slots, each has a set of pictures. The aim of the game is to get 3 the same pictures. In my game each slot is the simple folder in Cover Flow mode and in contrast WI the original game the movement of the slots is horizontal.
      </p>

      <h1>Dice game</h1>

      <p>
        Very simple. Normal folder in Preview mode shows previews of the image files, two in our case. Script copes such two images randomly
        and gives a combination of two dices.
