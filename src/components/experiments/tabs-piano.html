      <h1>Tabs as the piano keys</h1>

      <p>
        Once I woke up in the middle of night cause I got an idea: "what if tabs in browser were like the piano keys?". I wrote the thought down in Asana and got back to sleep.

      <p>
        In the morning I felt less enthusiastic about this idea until i realized that Google Chrome actually has hotkeys for changing tabs. The process of switching tabs resembles playing a piano and makes tabs a perfect musical instrument!
        Every tab has a music tone assigned. Seven tabs is one octave.
