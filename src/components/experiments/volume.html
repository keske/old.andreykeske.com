      <h1>Volume Experiments</h1>

      <h2>Fade out Effect</h2>

      <p>
        The idea is about the effect from real life: sound is louder when you are closer to the source and getting quiet when you are moving off.
        <br />
        There is an audioplayer at the top of page. When you are scrolling down sound volume gets quiter just like in real life.

      <h2>Resize volume</h2>

      <p>
        Larger speaker can produce sound more loudly. In my experiment I use the same principle â€” larger the window louder the sound it produces and vice versa.
